<h1>Coding</h1>
<p>Coding does something to the brain.</p>
<p>It structures it. It also introduces a dopamine reward mechanism when
you get a high when you get it <em>just</em> right and things worked as you
tell it so. No other activity that I know of allows such precise
control.</p>
<p>Coding itself is easy. Everyone can learn it in a week or less. But
<em>organising</em> code, specially at scale, that's the interest.</p>
<p>If you persevere long enough you will inevitably arrive at a hairy
mess you created and you will need to fix your own entangled code.</p>
<p>Arriving at this pain is critical to appreciate why design patterns
exist and what practical value they offer.</p>
<p>I met smart, knowledgeable people working in operations but when I read
their code I got a gut reaction to it. It was unmanageable. Unreusable.
Maybe it's how their messy brains work.</p>
<p>But I keep finding the people that do the best work in
operations/infrastructure/cloud were for a long enough time developers.
They think in layers and single responsabilities, reusability and
decoupling. Naming, punctation, attention to detail matter, because
compilers don't tolerate typos. Or sub- or dis- missively ignore errors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every time I open a shell script and I don't see what I'm gonna
call now EU mode (<code>set -eu</code>) or its better part <code>set -euo pipefail</code>
at the top I get worried.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone should be exposed at coding. Coding should be mandatory at
school, even if just for a few lessons. For most people it will not
stick. For others, it can become addictive and it will change how they
approach problems. It's a great mental tool.</p>
<p>Programming languages are the midway between human languages and math
(nature's language).</p>
