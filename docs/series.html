<h1>Series</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Veep</strong>: it's an amazing satirical series. Fast punch lines, a few
subtle jokes in an ocean of unafraid, brutal insults. Nev-AD-a!
&quot;We dated... and the world's gonna know that.&quot; #NotMe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Silicon Valley</strong>: one of the most funny, realistic, ironic peeks
into the startup world. Well thought and refreshingly up-to-date,
where the writers knew the end before opening the lenses for the
first shot. Halt and Catch Fire is another peek but it's not a
comedy. Irony happens when you try so hard to avoid something that
you inevitably fall doing exactly that. It's really hard to plot
right and Silicon Valley is full of them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Americans</strong>: underrated spy series. Slow burning,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYo-ziwOAWQ">realistic</a>. Humane
without getting mushy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like The Americans, <strong>Line of Duty</strong> is another slow burning series
about undercover operations. The writing will slow cook you to
helplessness. It's a sad, gripping show. Save it for when it rains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Succession</strong>: many people's favourite but the finale left too many loose
ends. Feels closer to reality than Billions. You could say, Billions
is how billionaires see themselves. Succession how they really are.
Same with The West Wing vs Veep for politicians. Allegedly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Peep Show</strong>: another underrated cringe, dry comedy series, that follows
2 goofy losers and their inner monologues. Not for everyone. Same
creator as Succession.</p>
</li>
</ul>
