<h1>Of Mice and Bulls</h1>
<p>There's an interesting dance when it comes to the top dog in a room. Be
that room a home, a company or even a country, where leaders are not
elected but rather choosen by the previous top dog.</p>
<p>A strong, assertive outspoken leader is many times followed by a more
quiet, thoughtful one. The bull and the mouse. And vice-versa. Yin-yang
kinda cycles.</p>
<h2>The bull</h2>
<p>A loud extroverted leader that revels in big picture, big talk needs to
rely on a quietly efficient counterpart to handle the pesky minutiae to
get actual things done. To bounce ideas and get an honest take on what's
happening or doable. Since he's not a threat (it can't possibly be!)
the extrovert protects and promotes the introvert. Over time the
introvert, the mouse, becomes Heir apparent. The mouse is grateful and
loyal to the bull that protects him.</p>
<h2>The mouse</h2>
<p>When the mouse is in power, he's no less brutal than the bull but the path
that took him to power, the details, is what he prefers. He has no patience
for people or dumbsplaining stuff to others. He now needs to rely on a
loyal bull to handle people with the firm hand the mouse never had an
interest to develop.</p>
<p>So the incentives are there for a bull and his mouse to appreciate each
other and coexist productively.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Does this happen <em>always</em>? No. But there are examples of this.</p>
<p>Steve Ballmer is a bull. A
<a href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/bullish">bullish</a>,
effervescent personality. A bit literally too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As opposed to many devs I always respected (and still do!) Ballmer's
<a href="https://youtu.be/8fcSviC7cRM">&quot;developers, developers, developers&quot;</a>
inspirational despite severely mocked and underappreciated talk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He followed a mouse. Bill Gates. After Ballmer, came Satya Nadella. A mouse.</p>
<p>Tim Cook, a mouse, followed Steve Jobs. A bull. Wozniak was a mouse. A
beautiful majestic mouse.</p>
<p>Stalin, a bull, was succeeded by Malenkov, a mouse.</p>
<p>Was Hitler a bull or a mouse? Not sure. Göring was a beautiful
bull. Goebbels and Himmler? Mice.</p>
<p>Putin is a mouse. Preceeded by Yeltsin. A bull.</p>
<p>It's like the bull fears rising bulls and the mouse rising mice. And
somehow they snuff them out.</p>
<h2>Notable Exceptions</h2>
<p>This analogy does seem to break in the corporate world though. In
sufficiently large companies, run by boards, where the non-founder CEO
is but a disposable employee, mice tend to abound. They survive
personality clashes and office politics better.</p>
<p>Does this mean any bulls need to live at the board level? Or the
shareholders behind these boards?</p>
<p>In traditional politics: are shadow figures in political parties
the real bulls? Some Éminence grise types inside them?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because it's becoming apparent the most impactful, critical,
hard-to-reverse decisions are not done at Prime Minister or
even President level. These are mostly replacable figure-heads,
with a back story built to entertain the masses and maintain
the illusion of choice. Some might be bland. Others very
colourful and controversial. But mice nonetheless.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or are we as a society generally trending towards a majority
mice-type personality?</p>
<p>I have no idea. An interesting dynamic though.</p>
