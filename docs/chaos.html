<h1>Knife's edge</h1>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39365187#39366352">In this comment</a>
someone remarked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>all companies are operating on a knife's edge</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it makes sense, when you think about it. It's the corollary of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if ain't broke don't fix it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Companies invest considerable time and money to get things off the
ground and make them work. I say to <em>barely</em> make them work.</p>
<p>Because most projects are completed beyond schedule and over budget.</p>
<p>As soon as that minimum acceptance is achieved there's less than zero
incentives to improve it. To polish it. Refactor it. To revisit tech
debt left behind. And sometimes completely rethink and redo it.</p>
<p>After the struggles to make it airborne, developers are keen to move
to shinnier things. Managers to end the apologising
and proclaim &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot; (<em>cue George W. Bush</em>).</p>
<p>Touching code that barely works becomes a risky adventure, that only
the approved enter, and only when there’s a clear JIRA ticket for it.
Fresh meat assigned to extend or fix stuff are only allowed to touch
the <em><strong>minimal</strong></em> amount of code, in the <em><strong>minimal</strong></em> amount of time.
So, every 10 years,  (<em>cue Tony Montana</em>) &quot;say hello to my little
friend&quot;, aka that big-bang rewrite.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Broken gets fixed but shoddy is forever</p>

<p>And that’s why, everywhere you go, every company is &quot;operating on a
knife’s edge&quot;.</p>

What products needs is constant attention.
