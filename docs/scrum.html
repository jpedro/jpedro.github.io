<h1>Scrum</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single developer
in possession of a good project, <em>must be</em> in sear hate of Scrum&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scrum sucks. The Zeitgeist (am I using this right??) shifted from
&quot;is it bad?&quot; to &quot;why is it so soo bad?&quot;. And there're no accepted
viable alternatives.</p>
<h2>Agile</h2>
<p>Agile, whatever that may be (<em>cue Prince Charles</em>), is not enough.</p>
<p>I like the ideas in the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a>
but those are just that: ideas. I get that for managers, that need
to justify development costs, that manifesto is meaningless. Wishful
thinking. I get it.</p>
<p>So Scrum swooped in and saved the day as a way to get workers to
<em>commit</em> to deadlines and <em>track</em> those. This is obviously important.</p>
<p>It also shorten the dev and deploy cycles from months and years of
waterfall to weeks. This is all nice and dandy. Calling it a sprint
however it sneakily introduces mental stress. A time pressure. And
pressure can become counter-productive.</p>
<p>Scrum make a concession though: it allows developers to estimate
themselves. Yes, themselves. Not the tasks. Because the senior can
do that in 1 day but junior over there needs 5.</p>
<h2>The killer</h2>
<p>Managers fail to grasp how hard is to get back into a coding state
of mind (flow) after meetings. It can take hours. Most of the time
it ruins the day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At least, that's what I tell myself. <em>Cue Seinfeld</em> &quot;It's not a lie
if you believe in it&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyway, you might <em>do something</em> but it's not as productive as before
that interruption.</p>
<p>And Scrum is <em>meeting heavy</em>. This carries appeal to managers,
by giving them a feeling that they are in the loop. Which they should.
Because they are the ones calming the customer down when things go
sideways.</p>
<p>Agile is all about ad-hoc interactions (&quot;Individuals and
interactions&quot;). Scrum on the other hand, establishes processes,
cadences, cerimonies, strangely named roles and resposibilities.
Opaque ways to track progress.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What problem does &quot;complexity points&quot; solve? The only metric that
matters is time. Sure, complexity can be understood to combine time
with an element of uncertainty but that translates to a multiplying
factor of... time. A sprint is a fixed amount of time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, Scrum, which is older than Agile, jumped into the Agile
bangwagon, got a restart and promises to be cool and flexible and
whatnot to get the devs onboard. But it really isn't.</p>
<p>It's the most anti-Agile thing ever. It's processes and tools. And
companies gobbled it. Because there's no viable alternative.</p>
<h2>The wasteland</h2>
<p>There are 5 ceremonies, 3 of them are a waste of time and only one
(a weekly meeting, combining task status and planning) is truly
essential.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sprint Planning: Needed</p>
<p>Should be done <em>every</em> week or every cycle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Daily Scrum: Optional</p>
<p>Most of time people just say &quot;I did this yesterday and
I'll continue on it today&quot;. Why. Even. Bother?!</p>
<p>But it acts as a daily reminder to devs if they are moving
along or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demo: Waste</p>
<p>Don't wait for the sprint to be over to <strong>show</strong> something.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retrospective: Waste</p>
<p>Don't wait for the sprint to be over to <strong>say</strong> something.
Just say it when you can. Then expand it on the weekly meeting, if
need be.</p>
<p>The rest of the time it's people trying to come up with something
clever to write on a postit. &quot;This went well. This went wrong.&quot; The
potential improvements are rarely followed up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backlog Refinement / Grooming: Waste</p>
<p>Superfulous, it's part of planning. No need for a separate meeting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The articles</h2>
<p>I'm not alone. I'm collecting here articles that share my long distaste
for it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://thecodist.com/yet-another-post-on-scrum-but-different/">Yet Another Post On Scrum, But Different</a></p>
<p>Andrew is very much against Scrum except in one instance where it
looks it did its job. But not how you think:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I worked at one place in the mid-2000s that decided they needed
a new process—it took more than a year and, when released, had 15
stages with meetings, documents, and sign-offs—and that was before
any code was written, which was simply the last step. <strong>The point</strong>
<strong>was IT did not want to write any more code, so the process was</strong>
<strong>designed to ensure that!</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Bold is mine)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.simplethread.com/agile-at-20-the-failed-rebellion/">Agile at 20: The Failed Rebellion</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scrum was invented to function in hostile environments. It's a
contract between hard-pushing managers and developers needing
time to think and explore.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This article points out that by not having devs on receiveing end of
the fruits of their labour, they got reduced to punch card workers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The alternatives</h2>
<p>37signals has an interesting approach. They have 6 weeks cycles
followed by a 2 week cool-off period. In the 6 weeks they ship
features. In the 2 weeks they polish what was done or play with
new stuff.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This appeals to me because it looks like 37 signals understands
the sharp difference between thinking and designing a thing and
implementing that thing. The first requires time, playfulness and
zero mental pressure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This operating model only works if you trust your employees to be
driven. Which in large companies doesn't happen and that's
another story.</p>
