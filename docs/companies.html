<h1>Companies</h1>
<p>Like stars and humans, companies have a life cycle.</p>
<p>And it's all about middle managers.</p>
<h2>Birth</h2>
<p>A baby company starts with:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An innovation, something new in the world (like Docker)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better execution. On price or value. Ideally both. That beats
the complacent competitors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Survival rates are low.</p>
<p>It's chaos.</p>
<p>Founders wear all hats and aprons.</p>
<p>There's no process. &quot;Process&quot; is getting shit done. Decisions
are discussions between 2 people. One was rubber ducking.
Sometimes, it's just inside one's head. Based on a single post
read the day before.</p>
<p>There is no time for this anyway.</p>
<p>Time to market is the most critical metric. It's about making
it work for the first customer. Those savings or loans won't last
forever. THEN make it pretty, appealing. Finally make it fast
(economically viable, viral, or performant).</p>
<h2>Alive</h2>
<p>If it hits the market and monetise quickly enough they can afford to
pay full time employees. The other option is to get investors. Either
way, the race to attract talent is on.</p>
<p>In the beginning the only option to attract qualified people away from
their income-predictable jobs is through stock options. But to do
that, those potential employees need to become convinced the product
will pay off. So they become much more engaged with it.</p>
<p>Founders tend to be pretty down to earth. Know everybody's weakeness
and strengths. Discussions involve everyone since a decision, an idea
or a pivot can have a life or death impact. People disagree in the
open but since it's a swim-or-sink situation most people &quot;disagree
and commit&quot;.</p>
<h2>Middle Age, Middle Managers</h2>
<p>As the company grows (revenue, profits, people) top management
tends to be pulled more onto the business side of things. Strategic
Innovation, Vision And Values. Cool shit like this. They get less
involved in the mundane implementation details and people doing it.</p>
<p>The middle age of middle managers inexorably arrives.</p>
<p>Because the CEO of 100 can't keep tabs on all of them like when
they were 10.</p>
<p>Middle managers' whose sole responsibility is to ensure decisions
at the top get implemented at the bottom. They enforce process and
policy.</p>
<p>Their voices don't carry the same weight. They disagree the least.
They aim to be at the top table and can't create too many waves.
They also might be aware they are the most replacable part of the
company.</p>
<p>Foot soldiers might disagree but because they lack the bigger
context that the top management has their opinions can be quickly
discarded. That context doesn't get propagated down because
something bad happened between a 20 and a 200 people company.</p>
<p>You don't trust your foot soldiers. Not because you don't want to.
Because you can't. Because you can't know they long and hard enough
to make a good judgment call. So you have to trust what</p>
<h2>Aged companies</h2>
<p>Mature customers prefer mature suppliers. They prefer paying a premium
for stability, predictability. An established credentials and a long
reputation in the market. Their tempos and MO match.</p>
<p>The opposite happens too. Casual companies have no patience for &quot;suits&quot;.</p>
<h2>The cause</h2>
<p>No. Middle managers mere existence don't sofucate and kill companies.
But they do reduce the flow of information between the Vision at the
top and the trenches at the bottom.</p>
<p>The whats flows down but not the whys. The critical data that made those
decisions less risky.</p>

## Cults

Severance is a great show that portrays that at some point, a company can
become a cult. (On the other hand, cults to be long lasting need to run
things like a company.)

Both rely on the same thing. The need to do more.

Both advertise opportunities for growth and promise to treat you like 
&quot;faaaamiily&quot;. Over time you are downgraded to a number, with a set of 
figures attached to your name. You are work force. There is even a human 
resources department to handle you. Really, to protect the company from 
you but anyway.

But someone can only extract more from another person if that person
can improve. Cults to do this by slowly crushing your spirit with
guilty. &quot;You are good. God loves you. But... you need to write me a
check or do this and that&quot;. More. There's never enough.

Companies use growth plans and career ladders, where your 
responsilibities and your impact radius increases but your pay
barely moves.
