# Boredom

Boredom is severly underrated.

Most people think it's a bad thing. Being bored is no fun and
*that's precisely the point here*.

I think it's critical to human development. Both at individual and
civilisation level. When people are bored they get restless and need
to do something about it. Being constantly bored at your job means soon
enough you will start looking for other things to do or improve what
you do do. If we didn't get bored we would just happily continue do
whatever we did. We would still live in caves. Happily. But nooooo.
Some dude decided he could build a roof. The gall!

Our brains crave incoming information to the point of
[even turning paranoid](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170526-inside-the-quietest-place-on-earth),
desperately compensating the lack of it. It's a marvel!


## We need more boredom

Our societies don't leave much room for it.
Everyone seems busy bees, all the time. We all have a list of things
we want to read, try, test somewhere. Probably on pinned browser tabs.
Hard to reach that magical moment where the brain spontaneously starts
to look for patterns. Stress also halts those lighting bulbs from
popping randomly in the shower.

Students in schools that have no homework perform better. Countries with
4+ weeks of paid vacations and a robust, free social welfare are not
less productive. Concerns after reducing the
[work week to 4 days](https://www.euronews.com/next/2024/02/02/the-four-day-week-which-countries-have-embraced-it-and-how-s-it-going-so-far)
were more centered on fairness across industries than productivity
discussions. Germany has one of the highest productivity ratios in
the world and one of the shortest average week working hours.

This is a case of "Not despite of. Because of".
