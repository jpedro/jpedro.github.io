# Knife's edge

[In this comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39365187#39366352)
someone remarked:

> all companies are operating on a knife's edge

And it makes sense, when you think about it. It's the outcome of:

> if ain't broke don't fix it

Companies invest considerable time and money to get things off the
ground and make them work. I say to _barely_ make them work.

Because most projects are completed beyond schedule and over budget.

As soon as that minimum acceptance is achieved there's less than zero
incentives to improve it. To polish it. Refactor it. To revisit tech
debt left behind. After the struggles to make it airborne, developers
are keen to move to shinnier things. Managers to end the apologising
and proclaim "Mission Accomplished" (_cue George W. Bush_).

Touching code that barely works becomes a risky adventure, that only
the approved are allowed to enter, and only when there’s a clear case
for it. Fresh meat assigned to add or fix stuff are only allowed to
touch the minimal amount of code, in the minimal amount of time. So,
every 10 years, "say hello to my little friend" (_cue Tony Montana_),
aka that big-bang rewrite.

And that’s why, everywhere you go, every company is "operating on a
knife’s edge".
