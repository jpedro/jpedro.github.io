# Of Mice and Bulls 

There's an interesting dance when it comes to the top dog in a room. Be
that room a home, a company or even a country, where leaders are not
elected but rather choosen.

A strong, assertive outspoken leader is many times followed by a more
quiet, thoughtful one. The bull and the mouse. And vice-versa. Yin-yang
kinda cycles.

A loud extroverted leader that revels in big picture, big talk needs to
rely on a quietly efficient counterpart to handle the pesky minutiae to
get actual things done. To bounce ideas and get an honest take on what's
doable or not. Since the latter is not a threat (it can't possibly be!)
the extrovert protects and promotes the introvert. Over time the
introvert, the mouse, becomes Heir apparent. The mouse is loyal to the
bull that protects him.

When the mouse is in power, he's no less brutal than the bull but the path
that took him to power, the details, is what he prefers. He has no patience
for people or dumbsplaining stuff to others. He now needs to rely on a
loyal bull to handle people with the firm hand the mouse never had an interest
to develop.

Does this happen _always_? No. But there are examples of this.

Steve Ballmer is a bull. A
[bullish](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/bullish),
effervescent personality. A bit literally too.

He followed a mouse. Bill Gates. After Ballmer, came Satya Nadella. A mouse.

Tim Cook, a mouse, followed Steve Jobs. A bull. Wozniak was a mouse. A
beautiful majestic mouse.

Stalin, a bull, was succeeded by Malenkov, a mouse.

Was Hitler a bull or a mouse? Not sure. Göring was a beautiful
bull. Goebbels and Himmler? Mice.

Putin is a mouse. Preceeded by Yeltsin. A bull.

It's like the bull fears rising bulls and the mouse rising mice. And
somehow they snuff them out.

This analogy does seem to break in the corporate world though. In
sufficiently large companies, run by boards, where the non-founder CEO
is but a disposable employee, mice tend to abound. They survive
personality clashes and office politics better.

Also in traditional politics.

Which begs the question: are figures in the political parties and investors
behind boards the bulls? Some Éminence grise inside them the real bulls?
This would be an intesting oxymoron. Or are we as a society generally
trending towards a majority mice-type personality?

I have no firm opinion. Still, an interesting dynamic.
