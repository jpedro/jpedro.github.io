# Coding

Coding does something to the brain.

It structures it. It also introduces a dopamine reward mechanism when
you get a high when you get it _just_ right and things worked as you
tell it so. No other activity that I know of allows such precise
control.

Coding itself is easy. Everyone can learn it in a week or less. But
_organising_ code, specially at scale, that's the interest.

If you persevere long enough you will inevitably arrive at a hairy
mess you created and you will need to fix your own entangled code.

Arriving at this pain is critical to appreciate why design patterns
exist and what practical value they offer.

I met smart, knowledgeable people working in operations but when I read
their code I got a gut reaction to it. It was unmanageable. Unreusable.
Maybe it's how their messy brains work.

But I keep finding the people that do the best work in
operations/infrastructure/cloud were for a long enough time developers.
They think in layers and single responsabilities, reusability and
decoupling. Naming, punctation, attention to detail matter, because
compilers don't tolerate typos. Or sub- or dis- missively ignore errors.

Everyone should be exposed at coding. Coding should be mandatory at
school, even if just for a few lessons. For most people it will not
stick. For others, it can become addictive and it will change how they
approach problems. It's a great mental tool.

Programming languages are the midway between human languages and math
(nature's language).
