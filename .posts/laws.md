# Laws (DRAFT)

We all have good and bad sides. Virtues might be a bit of a strectch. But not
vices. Those and annoyances we all have. More than we want to.

Laws are supposed to counter balance and temper our worst impulses.

In Scandinavia the [janteloven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Jante)
is a fantastic example of counter balance.
