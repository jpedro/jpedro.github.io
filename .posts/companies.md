# Companies

Like stars and humans, companies have a life cycle.


## Birth

A new baby company starts with either:

- An innovation, something new in the world (like Docker)

- Or better execution. Price or value. Ideally both. That beats
  complacent competitors. That value could be a better UI,
  better features or just lower prices.

The birth survival rate is quite low. Some point out that 9
out of 10 startups fail.


It's often chaotic. With the founders doing everything. Wearing
all the hats and aprons.

There's no need for process. The process is get shit done. Decisions are
discussions between 2 people. Sometimes, it's just inside one's head.

There is no time for it either.

**Time to market** is the most critical metric here. So, make it work.
THEN make it pretty. Then make it fast (economically viable, viral,
or performant. That means doing more with the same)

<!--
The order of these last 2 depends if you are doing a B2B or a B2C. B2C
needs to appeal to the end user. How performant the backend code
matters less to them. But if you are building a real time analytics
product, those miliseconds count. You need to capture that data. The
pretty dashboards can wait.

## Growth pains

If it hits the market and monetise quickly enough they can afford to
pay full time employees. The other option is to get investors.

Either way, the race to attract talent is on.

In the beginning the only option to attract qualified people away from
their income-predictable jobs is through stock options. But to do
that, those potential employees need to become convinced the product
will pay off.

Founders tend to be pretty down to earth. Know everybody's weakeness
and strengths. Discussions happen in the open since almost every decision
can be life or deathand a single idea or pivot can make an impact.

People disagree in the open. Disagreements will naturally arise but since all
are in a swim-or-sink situation most people will "disagree and commit".


# Middle Age, Middle Managers

As the company grows and, with it, revenue and profits, top management
tends to be pulled more onto the business side of things and get less
involved in implementation details.

The middle age of middle managers inexorably arrives.

Because a CEO of 100 people can't keep tabs on all of them.

Middle managers' whose sole responsibility is to ensure decisions
at the top get implemented to the bottom. They enforce process and
policy.

Their voices don't carry the same weight. They disagree the least
than any other groups in the company. In part because they aim to
be at the top table and can't create too many waves. They might be
aware they are the most replacable part of the company.

Foot soldiers might disagree but because they lack the bigger
context that the top management has their opinions can be quickly
discarded. That context doesn't get propagated down because
something bad happened between a 20 and a 200 people company.

You don't trust your foot soldiers. Not because you don't want to.
Because you can't. Because you can't know they long and hard enough
to make a good judgment call. So you have to trust what 


# Aged companies

Mature customers prefer mature suppliers. They prefer paying a premium
for stability and predictability. And established credentials and a
long reputation in the market.
