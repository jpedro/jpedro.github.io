## Scrum

> "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single developer
in possession of a good project, _must be_ in sear hate of Scrum".

Scrum sucks. The Zeitgeist (am I using this right??) shifted from
"is it bad?" to "why is it so soo bad?". And there're no accepted
viable alternatives.


## Agile

Agile, whatever that may be (_cue Prince Charles_), is not enough.

I like the ideas in the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)
but those are just that: ideas. I get that for managers, that need
to justify development costs, that manifesto is meaningless. Wishful
thinking. I get it.

So Scrum swooped in and saved the day as a way to get workers to
_commit_ to deadlines and _track_ those. This is obviously important.

It also shorten the dev and deploy cycles from months and years of
waterfall to weeks. This is all nice and dandy. Calling it a sprint
however it sneakily introduces mental stress. A time pressure. And
pressure can become counter-productive.

Scrum make a concession though: it allows developers to estimate
themselves. Yes, themselves. Not the tasks. Because the senior can
do that in 1 day but junior over there needs 5.


## The killer

Managers fail to grasp how hard is to get back into a coding state
of mind (flow) after meetings. It can take hours. Most of the time
it ruins the day.

> At least, that's what I tell myself. _Cue Seinfeld_ "It's not a lie
> if you believe in it".

Anyway, you might _do something_ but it's not as productive as before
that interruption.

And Scrum is _meeting heavy_. This carries appeal to managers,
by giving them a feeling that they are in the loop. Which they should.
Because they are the ones calming the customer down when things go
sideways.

Agile is all about ad-hoc interactions ("Individuals and
interactions"). Scrum on the other hand, establishes processes,
cadences, cerimonies, strangely named roles and resposibilities.
Opaque ways to track progress.

Also, Scrum, which is older than Agile, jumped into the Agile
bangwagon, got a restart and promises to be cool and flexible and
whatnot to get the devs onboard. But it really isn't.

It's the most anti-Agile thing ever. It's processes and tools. And
companies gobbled it. Because there's no viable alternative.


## The wasteland

There are 5 ceremonies, 3 of them are a waste of time and only one
(a weekly meeting, combining task status and planning) is truly
essential.

- Sprint Planning: Needed

  Should be done _every_ week or every cycle.

- Daily Scrum: Optional

  Most of time people just say "I did this yesterday and
  I'll continue on it today". Why. Even. Bother?!

  But it acts as a daily reminder to devs if they are moving
  along or not.

- Demo: Waste

  Don't wait for the sprint to be over to **show** something.

- Retrospective: Waste

  Don't wait for the sprint to be over to **say** something.
  Just say it when you can. Then expand it on the weekly meeting, if
  need be.

  The rest of the time it's people trying to come up with something
  clever to write on a postit. "This went well. This went wrong." The
  potential improvements are rarely followed up.

- Backlog Refinement / Grooming: Waste

  Superfulous, it's part of planning. No need for a separate meeting.



## The articles

I'm not alone. I'm collecting here articles that share my long distaste
for it.

- [Yet Another Post On Scrum, But Different](https://thecodist.com/yet-another-post-on-scrum-but-different/)

  Andrew is very much against Scrum except in one instance where it
  looks it did its job. But not how you think:

  > I worked at one place in the mid-2000s that decided they needed
  > a new process—it took more than a year and, when released, had 15
  > stages with meetings, documents, and sign-offs—and that was before
  > any code was written, which was simply the last step. **The point**
  > **was IT did not want to write any more code, so the process was**
  > **designed to ensure that!**

  (Bold is mine)

  > Scrum was invented to function in hostile environments. It's a
  > contract between hard-pushing managers and developers needing
  > time to think and explore. 


- [Developers Should Abandon Agile](https://ronjeffries.com/articles/018-01ff/abandon-1/)

- [Scrum is the Symptom, not the Problem](https://rethinkingsoftware.substack.com/p/scrum-is-the-symptom-not-the-problem)

  This article points out that by not having devs on receiveing end of
  the fruits of their labour, they got reduced to punch card workers.


## The alternatives

37signals has an interesting approach. They have 6 weeks cycles
followed by a 2 week cool-off period. In the 6 weeks they ship
features. In the 2 weeks they polish what was done or play with
new stuff.

> This appeals to me because it looks like 37 signals understands
> the sharp difference between thinking and designing a thing and
> implementing that thing. The first requires time, playfulness and
> zero mental pressure.

This operating model only works if you trust your employees to be
driven. Which in large companies doesn't happen and that's
another story.
