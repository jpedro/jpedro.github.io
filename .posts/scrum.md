## Scrum

Scrum sucks.

I like the ideas in the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)
but I understand for managers, that need to justify development costs
(that ties directly to development time), that manifesto is meaningless.
Wishful thinking.

So Scrum comes in as a way to get workers to estimate and commit to
deadlines and of course, track progress. This is, obviously,
important. And Scrum even allows developers to estimate themselves.
And most of the time they fail their own generous estimations. The gal!


## The fails

"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single developer
in possession of a good project, _must_ be in resentment of Scrum".

  — Proud and Prejudiced


**Meetings are work killers**.

Managers fail to grasp how hard is to get back into a coding flow state
of mind after meetings. It can take hours.

And Scrum is _meeting heavy_. This carries incredible appeal to managers,
by giving them a feeling that they are in the loop.

There are 5 ceremonies, 3 of
them are totally a waste of time and only one (a weekly meeting,
combining task status and planning) is truly essential.



### The wasteland

These are 5 ceremonies:

- Sprint Planning

  Should be done _every_ week or every cycle. The only one needed.

- Daily Scrum

  Should be optional. Most of time people just say "I did this and I'll
  continue on it". Why. Even. Bother?!

- Sprint Demo: Unnecessary

  Don't wait for the sprint to be over to **show** something.

- Sprint Retrospective: Unnecessary

  Don't wait for the sprint to be over to **say** something.
  Just say it when you can. Then expand it on the weekly meeting, if
  need be.

- Backlog Refinement / Grooming: Unnecessary

  Superfulous, it's part of planning. No need for a separate meeting.



## The articles

I'm not alone. I'm collecting here articles that share my long distaste
for it.

- [Yet Another Post On Scrum, But Different](https://thecodist.com/yet-another-post-on-scrum-but-different/)

  Andrew is very much against Scrum except in one instance where it
  looks it did its job. But not how you think:

  > I worked at one place in the mid-2000s that decided they needed
  > a new process—it took more than a year and, when released, had 15
  > stages with meetings, documents, and sign-offs—and that was before
  > any code was written, which was simply the last step. **The point**
  > **was IT did not want to write any more code, so the process was**
  > **designed to ensure that!**
