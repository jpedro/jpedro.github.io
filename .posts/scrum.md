## Scrum

Scrum sucks.

I like the ideas in the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)
but I understand for managers, that need to justify development
~costs~ time, that is meaningless.

Scrum is a way to get workers to estimate, commit to a deadline and
track their progress. This is, obviously, important.


## The fails

The problem is that managers fail to grasp how hard is to get back into
a coding flow state of mind after meetings. It can take hours.

**Meetings are work killers**.

And Scrum is _meeting heavy_. It's designed to appeal to managers, by
giving them a view into what's going on. There are 5 ceremonies, 3 of
them are totally a waste of time and only one (a weekly meeting,
combining task status and planning) is truly essential.



## The wasteland

These are 5 ceremonies:

- Sprint Planning: Required

  Should be done every week or every cycle.

- Daily Scrum: Optional

  Should be optional. Most of time people just say "I did this and I'll
  continue on it".

- Sprint Demo: Unnecessary

  Don't wait for the sprint to be over to **show** something.

- Sprint Retrospective: Unnecessary

  Don't wait for the sprint to be over to **say** something.
  Just say it when you can. Then expand it on the weekly meeting, if
  need be.

- Backlog Refinement: Unnecessary

  Superfulous, it's part of planning. No need for a separate meeting.



## The articles

I'm not alone. I'm collecting here articles that share my long distaste
for it.

- [Yet Another Post On Scrum, But Different](https://thecodist.com/yet-another-post-on-scrum-but-different/)

  Andrew is very much against Scrum except in one instance where it
  looks it did its job. But not how you think:

  > I worked at one place in the mid-2000s that decided they needed
  > a new process—it took more than a year and, when released, had 15
  > stages with meetings, documents, and sign-offs—and that was before
  > any code was written, which was simply the last step. **The point**
  > **was IT did not want to write any more code, so the process was**
  > **designed to ensure that!**
