## Scrum

> "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single developer
in possession of a good project, _must be_ in sear hate of Scrum".

Scrum sucks. People shifted from "is it bad?" to "why is it bad?"
And there's still no viable alternative.


## Agile

Agile, whatever that may be (_cue Prince Charles_), is not enough.

I like the ideas in the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)
but I understand for managers, that need to justify development costs
(that ties directly to development time), that manifesto is meaningless.
Wishful thinking.

So Scrum saved the day as a way to get workers to commit to deadlines
and track those. This is, obviously, important.

Scrum even make a concession: it allows developers to estimate
themselves. And most of the time they fail their own generous
estimations.


## Work Killers

Managers fail to grasp how hard is to get back into a coding state
of mind (flow) after meetings. It can take hours. Most of the time
it ruins the day. Yes, you might do something but it's not as
productive as before that meeting.

And Scrum is _meeting heavy_. This carries appeal to managers,
by giving them a feeling that they are in the loop. Which they should.
Because they are the ones calming the customer down when things take
longer.

But Agile is all about ad-hoc interactions ("Individuals and
interactions"). Scrum on the other hand, establishes processes,
cadences, cerimonies, strangely named roles and resposibilities.
Weird ways to track progress. What problem does "complexity points"
solve? The only metric that matters is development time.

Yes, Scrum, which is older than Agile, jumped into the Agile
bangwagon, got a restart and promises to be cool and flexible and
whatnot to get the devs onboard. But it really isn't.

It's the most anti-Agile thing ever. It's processes and tools. And
companies gobbled it. Because there's no viable alternative.


## The wasteland

There are 5 ceremonies, 3 of them are totally a waste of time and
only one (a weekly meeting, combining task status and planning) is
truly essential.

- Sprint Planning

  Should be done _every_ week or every cycle. The only one needed.

- Daily Scrum

  Should be optional. Most of time people just say "I did this and I'll
  continue on it". Why. Even. Bother?!

- Sprint Demo: Waste

  Don't wait for the sprint to be over to **show** something.

- Sprint Retrospective: Waste

  Don't wait for the sprint to be over to **say** something.
  Just say it when you can. Then expand it on the weekly meeting, if
  need be.

- Backlog Refinement / Grooming: Waste

  Superfulous, it's part of planning. No need for a separate meeting.



## The articles

I'm not alone. I'm collecting here articles that share my long distaste
for it.

- [Yet Another Post On Scrum, But Different](https://thecodist.com/yet-another-post-on-scrum-but-different/)

  Andrew is very much against Scrum except in one instance where it
  looks it did its job. But not how you think:

  > I worked at one place in the mid-2000s that decided they needed
  > a new process—it took more than a year and, when released, had 15
  > stages with meetings, documents, and sign-offs—and that was before
  > any code was written, which was simply the last step. **The point**
  > **was IT did not want to write any more code, so the process was**
  > **designed to ensure that!**

  (Bold is mine)

- [Developers Should Abandon Agile](https://ronjeffries.com/articles/018-01ff/abandon-1/)

- [Agile is Dead (Long Live Agility)](https://pragdave.me/thoughts/active/2014-03-04-time-to-kill-agile.html)

- [Why Scrum is Stressing You Out](https://rethinkingsoftware.substack.com/p/why-scrum-is-stressing-you-out)

- [Scrum is the Symptom, not the Problem](https://rethinkingsoftware.substack.com/p/scrum-is-the-symptom-not-the-problem)

  This articles points out that by not having devs on receiveing end of
  the fruits of their labour, they got reduced to punch card workers.


## Alternatives

37signals has an interesting approach. They have 6 weeks cycles
followed by a 2 week cool-off period. And in the 6 weeks they ship
features. In the 2 weeks they polish what was done or play with
new stuff.
