# Hubris

The cardinal sin of qualified people.

The opposite of "stay hungry; stay foolish". A quote Steve Jobs
liked to use.

Being the best is totally fine. Somebody has to. But knowing,
thinking, even acknowledging is the path to the dark side and
that innevitable hubric fall.

The moment our brains pause and reflect on how good we are,
that's the nanosecond those downfall clocks start counting down.


## AI

If AI didn't dominate so much in the dev news, the focus would be on
Rust.

But AI is all the rage now, so Rust stays under the radar. This only
speeds up its hubric fall.


## The Push

Tech normally is decided bottom-up. Devs choose the tools that
make their lives easier, more productive and eventually they win
by showing off to others. When a tool is that good, people want
to jump in. They don't operate with enforcement directives.

But like AI, Rust is being pushed, _hard_, to replace systems and
tools. For example, git and apt will add the rust toolchain into
their build processes.

Rust adoption doesn't feel organic. Which makes me think, like AI,
this is a top-down decision. The powers that be have an interest
in forcing Rust into places. Why?


## The Community

The community does not welcome criticism. It shuts it down. Fast.
Which is **NOT** a tactic used by nerds, trying to win you over.
If they do bother to try, they do it with the raw superiority of
the tech.


## Examples

The JVM is a performant runtime but Java has carried a stigma of
bloated code. Why? Because the developers went too far in the pursuit
of OOP and design patterns. Exception stack traces in Java are long
because of the layers, deep inheritance. Because God forbid to write
directly to stdout. No no. There needs to be an interface, a root
abstract class, many subclasses, serialization adapters and a
convinient factory to log lines. Less that that and it's not enterprise
grade.
