## Boredom

Boredom is severly underrated. (I know, that word comes here a lot.)

Most people think it's a bad thing. Being bored is no fun but boredom
is. I think it's critical to human development, both at individual and
civilisation level. When people are bored they get restless and need
to do something about it. Being constantly bored at your job means soon
enough you will start looking for other things to do or improve what
you do do.

If we didn't get bored we would just happily continue do whatever
we did. We would still leave in caves. Happily. But no.

Our brains demands incoming information to the point of
[even turning paranoid](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170526-inside-the-quietest-place-on-earth),
desperately compensating for the lack of stimuli. It's a
marvel!

All this to say, **we need more boredom**. Our societies barely allow
room for this. Everyone seems too busy all the time. Hard to reach
that the magical moment where the brain starts to see patterns we
missed (whether they are real or immaginary is another topic).

Students in schools that have no homework perform better. Companies with
4+ weeks of vacations and free wealthcare do not perform worse. The
brain doesn't just need sleep. It also needs downtime during the day.
Then those brains are sorted and ready for new intakes.

I get this feeling civilisation peaked around the 1800's. The music,
the arts, the sciences. Improvements after are huge on absolute
terms but in relative terms, in orders of magnitute to the previous
iteration, I think we are slowly slowing down.

There's an optimal point between access to information and overflooded
with it. An optimal point between fight for survival all the time and

## Coding

Coding does something to your brain. Basically it structures it.

Maybe other activities do that too but if you code long enough you will
inevitably arrive at big hairy problems you created and you will need
to fix your own entangled code.

Coding itself is easy. Everyone can learn it in a week or less. But
_organising_ code, specially at scale, that's the interest.

I met smart, knowledgeable people working in operations but when I read
their code I got a gut reaction to it. It was unmanageable. Unreusable.

Maybe it's how their messy brains work. But I keep finding the people
that do the best work in operations/infrastructure/cloud were for a
long enough time developers. They think in layers and single
responsabilities, reusability and decoupling.

Everyone should be exposed at coding. Coding should be mandatory at
school, even if just for a few lessons. Sometimes it doesn't stick. For
others, it can become addictive and it will change how they approach
problems.

Programming languages are the midway between human languages and
math.


## Series

- Veep: it's an amazing satirical series. Fast punch lines, a few
  subtle jokes in an ocean of unafraid, brutal insults. Nev-AD-a!
  #NotMe

- Silicon Valley: one of the most funny, realistic, ironic peeks into
  the startup world. Well thought and refreshingly up-to-date, where
  the writers knew the end before opening the lenses for the first shot.
  Halt and Catch Fire is another peek is but this one is not a comedy.
  Irony happens when you try so much to avoid something that you
  inevitably fall doing exactly it. It's really hard to plot right
  and Silicon Valley is full of them.

- The Americans: underrated spy series. Slow burning, feels realistic.
  Humane without getting mushy.

- Succession: many people's favourite but the end let too many loose
  ends unsolved. Feels closer to reality than Billions. Billions is how
  billionaries think they are. Succession how they really are.

- Peep Show: another underrated cringe series but not for everyone.
  Same creator as Succession.


## Sounds

Sometimes I wonder how much music or how many songs connect to us at a
deeper level because they resemble sounds we hear in the womb.

Can you see in there? No. Can you smell, touch or taste? Prob not.

The sole source of external stimuli are sounds.

Just think. In total darkness, floating in that warm, sensory-deprived
amniotic universe. It has be the ultimate ASMR experience.


## Undersold

The most undersold value of the cloud is their unified API. Why?

Because AU. TO. MA. TION.

Those API calls are the smallest lego pieces. Atop that, you can
assemble walls, rooms, flats, houses, buildings. Whole cities in the
cloud can be captured in a git repo, automated, packaged in a library,
a service or a platform.

Most ad-hoc scripts and home brewed provisioning tools can't even agree
on a standard for the _sand_ that builds the bricks.


## Don't

Sometimes you don't need a cloud. Deploy that app straight into a bare
host. Use unix sockets. Avoid the TCP/IP network overheads.

You better pray the backups are working when things fail (which they
will) but until then, it's the best performance you will _ever_ get.


## Knife's edge

[In this comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39365187#39366352)
someone remarked:

> all companies are operating on a knife's edge

And it makes sense, when you think about it. It's the outcome of:

> if ain't broke don't fix it

Companies invest considerable time and money to get things off the
ground and make them work. I say to barely make them work.

Because most projects are completed beyond schedule and over budget.

As soon as that minimum acceptance is achieved there's less than zero
incentives to improve it. To polish it. Refactor it. But also to
revisit the tech debt left behind. After the struggles to make it
airborne, developers are keen to move to shinnier things. Managers
to end the apologising and proclaim "Mission Accomplished"
(_cue George W. Bush_).

Touching code that barely works becomes a risky adventure, that only
the approved go, and only when there’s a clear case for it. Fresh meat
assigned to add features or fix stuff are only allowed to touch the
minimal amount of code, in the smallest amount of time. So, every
10 years, "say hello to my little friend" (_cue Tony Montana_), aka
that big-bang rewrite.

And that’s why, everywhere you go, every company is "operating on a
knife’s edge".
