# Random Stuff

## Coding

Coding does something to your brain. Basically it structures it.

Maybe other activities do that too but if you code long enough you will
inevitably arrive at big hairy problems you created and fix your own
entangled code.

Coding is easy. Everyone can learn it in a week or less. But organising
code, specially at scale... that's the real "learnings" (in corporate
speech).

Writing one or more functions is trivial but what should be inside those
functions?

I met some smart people working in operations that were great at
knowing infrastructure like no one else. But when I read their code I
got gut reactions to it.


## Series

- Veep: it's an amazing satirical series. Fast punch lines, a few
  subtle jokes in an ocean of unafraid, brutal insults. Nev-AD-a!
  #NotMe

- Silicon Valley: one of the most funny, realistic, ironic peeks into
  the startup world. Well thought and refreshingly up-to-date, where
  the writers knew the end before opening the lenses for the first shot.
  Halt and Catch Fire is another peek is but this one is not a comedy.
  Irony happens when you try so much to avoid something that you
  inevitably fall doing exactly it. It's really hard to plot right
  and Silicon Valley is full of them.

- The Americans: underrated spy series. Slow burning, feels realistic.
  Humane without getting mushy.

- Succession: many people's favourite but the end let too many loose
  ends unsolved. Feels closer to reality than Billions. Billions is how
  billionaries think they are. Succession how they really are.

- Peep Show: another underrated cringe series but not for everyone.
  Same creator as Succession.


## Sounds

Sometimes I wonder how much music or how many songs connect to us at a
deeper level because they resemble sounds we hear in the womb.

Can you see in there? No. Can you smell, touch or taste? Prob not.

The sole source of external stimuli are sounds.

Just think. In total darkness, floating in that warm, sensory-deprived
amniotic universe. It has be the ultimate ASMR experience.


## Undersold

The most undersold value of the cloud is their unified API. That's it.

Why so important? Because AU. TO. MA. TION.

Those API calls are the smallest lego pieces. Atop that, you can
assemble walls, rooms, flats, houses, buildings. Whole cities in the
cloud can be captured in a git repo.

Most ad-hoc scripts and home brewed provisioning tools can't even agree
on a standard for the _sand_ that builds the bricks.


## Don't

Sometimes you don't need a cloud. Deploy that app straight into a bare
host. Use unix sockets. Avoid the TCP/IP network overheads.

You better pray the backups are working when things fail (which they
will) but until then, it's the best performance you will _ever_ get.


## Knife's edge

[In this comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39365187#39366352)
someone remarked:

> all companies are operating on a knife's edge

And it makes sense, when you think about it. It's the outcome of:

> if ain't broke don't fix it

Companies invest considerable time and money to get things off the
ground and make them work. I say to barely make them work.

Because most projects are completed beyond schedule and over budget.

As soon as that minimum acceptance is achieved there's less than zero
incentives to improve it. To polish it. Refactor it. But also to
revisit the tech debt left behind. After the struggles to make it
airborne, developers are keen to move to shinnier things. Managers
to end the apologising and proclaim "Mission Accomplished"
(_cue George W. Bush_).

Touching code that barely works becomes a risky adventure, that only
the approved go, and only when there’s a clear case for it. Fresh meat
assigned to add features or fix stuff are only allowed to touch the
minimal amount of code, in the smallest amount of time. So, every
10 years, "say hello to my little friend" (_cue Tony Montana_), aka
that big-bang rewrite.

And that’s why, everywhere you go, every company is "operating on a
knife’s edge".
