# Blog decision

I started a few blogs but failed. Not knowing what to write and the right tool
was not obvious for quite a while.

Many people highlighted the value of writing down stuff. It requires some time
but I'll try this now.


## Enter GitHub

I've been collecting a few notes on GitHub repos and there's of course gists.
The 2 things that changed my opinion to use GitHub as a static blog thing was:

1. GitHub uses the `<user>.github.io` repo as the repo whose page will be
   rendered in user.github.io.

2. GitHub actually renders markdown pages directly with no need to add a theme.
   And the colors and layout is decent enough to work.


## Todos

- [ ]  Add metadata (via comments) to pages, like tags, summary, created and
       have a script running from GitHub actions that generates the `tags/`
       index page.

- [ ]  Add a comments section on each page.
