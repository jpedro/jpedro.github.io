# Series

- Veep: it's an amazing satirical series. Fast punch lines, a few
  subtle jokes in an ocean of unafraid, brutal insults. Nev-AD-a!
  #NotMe

- Silicon Valley: one of the most funny, realistic, ironic peeks into
  the startup world. Well thought and refreshingly up-to-date, where
  the writers knew the end before opening the lenses for the first shot.
  Halt and Catch Fire is another peek but it's not a comedy. Irony
  happens when you try so hard to avoid something that you inevitably
  fall doing exactly that. It's really hard to plot right and Silicon
  Valley is full of them.

- The Americans: underrated spy series. Slow burning,
  [realistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYo-ziwOAWQ). Humane
  without getting mushy.

- Like The Americans, Line of Duty is another slow burning series about
  undercover operations. The writing will slow cook you to helplessness.
  It's a sad, gripping show. Save it for when it rains.

- Succession: many people's favourite but the finale left too many loose
  ends. Feels closer to reality than Billions. You could say, Billions
  is how billionaires see themselves. Succession how they really are.
  Same The West Wing vs Veep. How politicians see themselves vs how
  they really are. Allegedly.

- Peep Show: another underrated cringe, dry comedy series. Not for
  everyone. Same creator as Succession.
