# Companies life cycle

Like humans, all companies have a life cycle.

They are created at some point. Althought the success rate of surving
birth is low. Some point at 9 out of 10 startups fail.

But the founders tend to be either of two groups:

- Young people that have an idea and put all their effort to monetize on it.
- Established players, that decided they can do better on their rather than
  inside their previous companies.
  

# Childhood

When a company is young, it's often chaotic. With the founders doing a bit of
everything.

They have no processes because there's no need for one. The "process" is a
discussion between 2 heads. Sometimes, just in one's head. If a founder is a
techie and the other is not, technical decisions happend in the tech's head.

And it doesn't matter.

Time to market is essential here. Make it work. THEN make it fast and make it
pretty. The order here depends if you are doing a B2B or a B2C. B2C needs to
appealing to the end user.

If they hit the market quickly and start paying full time employees, or
get fund raised, the race to attract talent starts. In the beginning the
only option to attract qualified people away from their stables jobs is
through stock options. But to do that, those potential employees need to be
convinved the idea works and has potential to pay off leaving their
comfort cozy seats.

In the beginning, the founders tend to be realistic, approachable and
discussions tend to be pretty open. The founders can keep tabs on most things
that are happening. They can disagree openly and get counter arguments back.
Disagreements will naturally arise but since all are in a swim or sink
situation most people disagree and commit.


# Middle aged

As the company grows and, with it, revenue, profits, the top management
tends to be pulled more onto the business side of things and get less
involved in the mundane aspects of implementation.

The need to have middle managers inexorably arrives. These are people whose
sole responsibility is to ensure decisions at the top get propagated and
implemented down to the bottom. Because they were not there at the beginning
their mandate and the weight of their voices doesn't carry as much weight.
They disagree less than any other groupo in the company. They are basically
the enforcers of policy.

The foot soldiers might disagree out loud but because they lack the bigger
picture that the top management has, their opinions tend to be discarded or
minimised. They could had been given the full picture of potential future deals
but that would a distraction from coding and could create a "too many cooks"
situation. So normally only the perceived best are brought here and there to
voice their opinions. Which makes sense as the company grows the number of
disparate and contradictory ways of work will arise from people with different
experiences and outlooks. And lets face. Most foot soldiers don't care or
have a strong opinion on strategic matters.
