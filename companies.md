# Companies life cycle

Like humans and stars, all companies have a life cycle.

They are created at some point. Either by having a whole new innovative
idea or by figurying out a better execution that will beat competitors.
The success rate of surving birth is low. Some point at 9 out of 10
startups failing.

But the founders tend to be either of two groups:

- Younger people that have an idea and put all their effort to monetize on it.
- Established players, that decided they can do better on their rather than
  complacent aged companies.
  

# Childhood

When a company is young, it's often chaotic. With the founders doing a bit of
everything.

They have no processes because there's no need for one. The "process" is a
discussion between 2 heads. Sometimes, just in one. If a founder is a techie
and the other is not, technical decisions happend in the tech's head.

And it doesn't matter.

Time to market is the most critical here. Make it work. THEN make it fast and
make it pretty. The order here depends if you are doing a B2B or a B2C. B2C
needs to appealing to the end user. How performant the backend code matters
less.

If they hit the market and monetise quickly they can afford to pay full time
employees. The other option is to get fund raised. Either way, the race to
attract talent is on.

In the beginning the only option to attract qualified people away from their
stable jobs is through stock options. But to do that, those potential
employees need to become convinved the idea works pays off leaving their
comfortable predictable cozy positions.

Nobody with a family to raise and loans to repay can afford a risky career
move.

In the beginning, the company being less than 10 people, founders tend to be
pretty down to earth, approachable. Discussions tend to be pretty open since
it's possible you can sit with the CEO at lunch and talk about almost everything.
They can keep tabs on most things that are happening. They can disagree openly
and hear counter arguments back. Disagreements will naturally arise but since
all are in a swim-or_sink situation most people can disagree and commit.


# Middle aged

As the company grows and, with it, revenue, profits, the top management
tends to be pulled more onto the business side of things and get less
involved in the mundane aspects of implementation.

The age for middle managers inexorably arrives.

These are people whose sole responsibility is to ensure major decisions at
the top get propagated and implemented down to the bottom. Because they were
not there at the beginning their mandate and their voices doesn't carry the
same weight. They disagree less than any other groupo in the company. They are
basically the enforcers of policy.

The foot soldiers might disagree out loud but because they lack the bigger
picture that the top management has. Their opinions tend to be discarded or
minimised.

They could had been given the full picture of potential future deals but that
would a distraction from coding and could create a "too many cooks" situation.
So normally only the perceived best are brought here and there to voice their
opinions. Which makes sense as the company grows the number of disparate and
contradictory ways of work will arise from people with different experiences
and outlooks. And let's face. Most foot soldiers don't care or have a strong
opinion on strategic matters anyway.
