# Random Thoughts

## Sounds

Sometimes I wonder how much music or how many songs connect to us at a
deeper level because they resemble sounds we hear in the womb.

Can you see in there? No. Can you smell, touch or taste? Prob not.

All external stimuli are sounds.

Just think. In total darkness, floating in that dark, warm,
sensory-deprived amniotic universe. It has be the ultimate ASMR
experience.


## Undersold

The most undersold value of the cloud is their unified API. That's it.

Why so important? Because AU. TO. MA. TION.

Those API calls are the smallest lego pieces. Atop that, you can
assemble walls, rooms, flats, houses, buildings. Whole cities in the
cloud can be captured in a git repo.

Most ad-hoc scripts and home brewed provisioning tools can't even agree
on a standard for the _sand_ that builds the bricks.


## Don't

Sometimes you don't need a cloud. Deploy that app straight into a bare
host. Use unix sockets, avoid the whole TCP/IP network overheads.

You better pray the backups are working when things fail (which they
will) but until then, it's the best performance you will _ever_ get.


## Knife's edge

[In this comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39365187#39366352)
someone remarked:

And it makes sense, when you think about it. It's the outcome of:

> if ain't broke don't fix it

Companies invest considerable time and money to get things off the
ground and make them work. I say to barely make them work.

Because most projects are completed beyond schedule and over budget.

As soon as that minimum acceptance is achieved there's less than zero
incentives to improve it. To polish it. Refactor it. But also to
revisit the tech debt left behind. After the struggles to make it
airborne, developers are keen to move to shinnier things. Managers
to end the apologising and proclaim "Mission Accomplished"
(_cue George W. Bush_).

Touching code that barely works becomes a risky adventure, that only
the approved go, and only when there’s a clear for it. Fresh meat
assigned to add features or fix stuff are only allowed to touch the
minimal amount of code, in the smallest amount of time. So, every
10 years, "say hello to my little friend" (_cue Tony Montana_), aka
that big-bang rewrite.

And that’s why, everywhere you go, every company is "operating on a
knife’s edge".
