# Coding

Coding does something to your brain.

It structures it. It also introduces a dopamine reward mechanism when
you get a high when you get it just right and things worked as you
said so. No other activity that I know of allows such precise control.

Coding itself is easy. Everyone can learn it in a week or less. But
_organising_ code, specially at scale, that's the interest.

If you persevere long enough you will inevitably arrive at a hairy
mess you created and you will need to fix your own entangled code.

I met smart, knowledgeable people working in operations but when I read
their code I got a gut reaction to it. It was unmanageable. Unreusable.
Maybe it's how their messy brains work.

But I keep finding the people that do the best work in
operations/infrastructure/cloud were for a long enough time developers.
They think in layers and single responsabilities, reusability and
decoupling. Naming, punctation, attention to detail matter, because
compilers don't tolerate typos.

Everyone should be exposed at coding. Coding should be mandatory at
school, even if just for a few lessons. Sometimes it doesn't stick. For
others, it can become addictive and it will change how they approach
problems.

It's a great mental tool. Programming languages are the midway between
human languages and math (nature's language).
