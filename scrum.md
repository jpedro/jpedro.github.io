# Why SCRUM fails

<!-- START TAGS -->
<!-- END TAGS -->

## Why

SCRUM is basically a way to get workers to commit to a timeframe and
track its progress.


## What

There are 5 "ceremonies". 3 are idiotic. 1 should be optional.

- ✅ Sprint Planning

  Should be done every week.

- ❓ Daily Scrum

  Should be optional. Most of time people ust say "I did this and I'll
  continue on it"

- ❌ Sprint Review

  Don't wait for the "sprint" to be over to **show** something.

- ❌ Sprint Retrospective

  Don't wait for the "sprint" to be over to **say** something.

- ❌ Backlog Refinement

  Superfulous, it's part of planning.
