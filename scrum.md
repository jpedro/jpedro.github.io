## Scrum

I like the ideas in the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)
but I understand for managers, that need to justify development
~costs~ time, that is meaningless.

Scrum is a way to get workers to estimate, commit to a deadline and
track their progress. This is, obviously, important.


## Why such failures

The problem is that managers fail to grasp how hard is to get back into
a coding flow state of mind after meetings. It can take hours.

**Meetings are work killers**.

And Scrum is _meeting heavy_. It's designed to appeal to managers, by
giving them a view into what's going on. There are 5 ceremonies, 3 of
them are totally a waste of time and only one (a weekly meeting,
combining task status and planning) is truly essential.


## The articles

I'm not alone. I'm collecting here articles that share my long distaste
for it.

## The waste

These are 5 ceremonies:

- Sprint Planning: Required

  Should be done every week or every cycle.

- Daily Scrum: Optional

  Should be optional. Most of time people just say "I did this and I'll
  continue on it".

- Sprint Demo: Unnecessary

  Don't wait for the sprint to be over to **show** something.

- Sprint Retrospective: Unnecessary

  Don't wait for the sprint to be over to **say** something.
  Just say it when you can. Then expand it on the weekly meeting, if
  need be.

- Backlog Refinement: Unnecessary

  Superfulous, it's part of planning. No need for a separate meeting.
