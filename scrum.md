# Why SCRUM fails

<!-- START TAGS -->
<!-- END TAGS -->

## Why

SCRUM is basically a way to get workers to commit to a timeframe and
track its progress.


## What

There are 5 "ceremonies".

1 is required for every project. 1 should be optional. The other 3 are
idiotic.

- ✅ Sprint Planning

  Should be done every week or every cycle.

- ❓ Daily Scrum

  Should be optional. Most of time people ust say "I did this and I'll
  continue on it"

- ❌ Sprint Review

  Problem: Don't wait for the sprint to be over to **show** something.

- ❌ Sprint Retrospective

  Problem: Don't wait for the sprint to be over to **say** something.

- ❌ Backlog Refinement

  Problem: Superfulous, it's part of planning.
