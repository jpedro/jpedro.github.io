## On a knife's edge

someone remarked:

> all companies are operating on a knife's edge

And it makes sense, when you think about it. It's the outcome of:

> if ain't broke don't fix it

Companies invest considerable time and money to get things off the
ground and make them work. And _just that_. Even **barely that**.

As soon as that minimum level is achieved (most times beyond schedule
and over budget) there's zero or negative incentives to improve it. To
polish it. Refactor it. To what we all know are better standards.

Developers want to move on to shinnier things, after the initial
uphill struggle to make it work. Project managers want to mark them as
"Mission Accomplished".

Touching code that barely works becomes a risky adventure, that's only
approved when there's a bug or a security issue.

Sometimes the knowledge learned is carried to other, shinner projects.
Other times, new hires need to add new features that someone is paying
for. They read the now stale code and they think "This could have been
done better" but they are only allowed to touch the minimal amount of
code, in the smallest amount of time.

Cruft accumulates and around every 10 years is time for that big-bang
rewrite.

And that's why it feels, everywhere you go, every company is "operating
on a knife's edge". Because even if you know what should be done,
there's no time, no JIRA ticket or project for it and no approval.
