## The end

Sometimes the means to an end are not the means to the end. They are
the end goal themselves. The real end is the "means". Enough said.

## Simplicity

In the age of microservices (yes, without a space or the hyphen)
monoliths are coming back in fashion. With a reason. They are just
simpler. Simpler to grasp, simpler to deploy and simpler to monitor.

Microservices might solve some problems but introduce overheads,
complexity. A natural fit for microservices can be a container
runtime, like ECS or even better, Kubernetes

https://tableplus.com/blog/2024/03/how-we-deal-with-ddos.html
has a great article on how their monolith brings them a lot of value,
in that case, in terms of not caring their ongoing DDoS attack.

Not all products or platforms can afford a monolith though, or having
a single binary that serves all requests. Then _and only then_ you
should plan to carve out one or more services out of that
[majestic monolith](https://signalvnoise.com/svn3/the-majestic-monolith/).
I say the main drivers should be the tech stack (meaning the choice of
programming language or framework) and distinct business requirements.

## Mastery

The internets tell me mastery is spending 10 000 hours doing
something. Cute but no. I prefer this:

> It's when you made all the possible mistakes you can. Over and over

> Even then, maybe...


## In my shoe

From my limited viewpoint, the worst managers are the one that were
very technical at some point. And it's worse the more recently that
transition happened.

I'm not bragging but I know I would be a terrible manager. Because I'm
fussy about code. A comma or a space out of place done by someone else
is a like a particle in my shoe. I might not remove it immediately but
my brain knows it's theeeeere!

When you code, you have absolute control over every character you type.
That translate poorly when managing people.

## Boredom

Boredom is severly underrated.

Most people think it's a bad thing. Being bored is no fun and
*that's precisely the point here*.

I think it's critical to human development. Both at individual and
civilisation level. When people are bored they get restless and need
to do something about it. Being constantly bored at your job means soon
enough you will start looking for other things to do or improve what
you do do. If we didn't get bored we would just happily continue do
whatever we did. We would still live in caves. Happily. But nooooo.
Some dude decided he could build a roof. The gall!

Our brains crave incoming information to the point of
[even turning paranoid](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170526-inside-the-quietest-place-on-earth),
desperately compensating the lack of it. It's a marvel!

**We need more boredom**. Our societies don't leave much room for it.
Everyone seems busy bees, all the time. We all have a list of things
we want to read, try, test somewhere. Probably on pinned browser tabs.
Hard to reach that magical moment where the brain spontaneously starts
to look for patterns. Stress also halts those lighting bulbs from
popping randomly in the shower.

Students in schools that have no homework perform better. Countries with
4+ weeks of paid vacations and a robust, free social welfare are not
less productive. Concerns after reducing the
[work week to 4 days](https://www.euronews.com/next/2024/02/02/the-four-day-week-which-countries-have-embraced-it-and-how-s-it-going-so-far)
were more centered on fairness across industries than productivity
discussions. Germany has one of the highest productivity ratios in
the world and one of the shortest average week working hours.

This is a case of "Not despite of. Because of".

I get this feeling civilisation peaked around the 1800's. The music,
the arts, the sciences. Improvements after are huge on absolute
terms but in relative terms, in orders of magnitute to the previous
iteration, I think we are slowly slowing down.

## Coding

Coding does something to your brain.

It structures it. It also introduces a dopamine reward mechanism when
you get a high when you get it just right and things worked as you
said so. No other activity that I know of allows such precise control.

Coding itself is easy. Everyone can learn it in a week or less. But
_organising_ code, specially at scale, that's the interest.

If you persevere long enough you will inevitably arrive at a hairy
mess you created and you will need to fix your own entangled code.

I met smart, knowledgeable people working in operations but when I read
their code I got a gut reaction to it. It was unmanageable. Unreusable.
Maybe it's how their messy brains work.

But I keep finding the people that do the best work in
operations/infrastructure/cloud were for a long enough time developers.
They think in layers and single responsabilities, reusability and
decoupling. Naming, punctation, attention to detail matter, because
compilers don't tolerate typos.

Everyone should be exposed at coding. Coding should be mandatory at
school, even if just for a few lessons. Sometimes it doesn't stick. For
others, it can become addictive and it will change how they approach
problems.

It's a great mental tool. Programming languages are the midway between
human languages and math (nature's language).


## Series

- Veep: it's an amazing satirical series. Fast punch lines, a few
  subtle jokes in an ocean of unafraid, brutal insults. Nev-AD-a!
  #NotMe

- Silicon Valley: one of the most funny, realistic, ironic peeks into
  the startup world. Well thought and refreshingly up-to-date, where
  the writers knew the end before opening the lenses for the first shot.
  Halt and Catch Fire is another peek but it's not a comedy. Irony
  happens when you try so hard to avoid something that you inevitably
  fall doing exactly that. It's really hard to plot right and Silicon
  Valley is full of them.

- The Americans: underrated spy series. Slow burning,
  [realistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYo-ziwOAWQ). Humane
  without getting mushy.

- Like The Americans, Line of Duty is another slow burning series about
  undercover operations. The writing will slow cook you to helplessness.
  It's a sad, gripping show. Save it for when it rains.

- Succession: many people's favourite but the finale left too many loose
  ends. Feels closer to reality than Billions. You could say, Billions
  is how billionaires see themselves. Succession how they really are.
  Same The West Wing vs Veep. How politicians see themselves vs how
  they really are. Allegedly.

- Peep Show: another underrated cringe, dry comedy series. Not for
  everyone. Same creator as Succession.


## Sounds

Sometimes I wonder how much music or how many songs connect to us at a
deeper level because they resemble sounds we hear in the womb. Can we
see, smell, touch, taste in there? No, no, and probably not.

The sole source of stimuli are sounds.

Just think. In total darkness, floating in that warm, sensory-deprived
amniotic universe. It has be the ultimate ASMR experience.


## Undersold

The most undersold value of the cloud is their unified API. Why?

Because AU. TO. MA. TION.

Those API calls are the smallest lego pieces. Atop that, you can
assemble walls, rooms, flats, houses, buildings. Whole cities in the
cloud can be captured in a repo, automated, packaged as a library,
a cli or some tool, service or platform.

Most ad-hoc scripts and home brewed provisioning tools can't even agree
on a standard for the sand that builds the bricks.

Totally unrelated: [I have a bridge to sell to you](/hosting).


## Don't

Sometimes you don't need a cloud. Deploy that app straight into a bare
host. Use unix sockets. Avoid TCP/IP network overheads.

You better pray the backups are working when things fail (which they
will) but until then, it's the best performance you will _ever_ get.


## Knife's edge

[In this comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39365187#39366352)
someone remarked:

> all companies are operating on a knife's edge

And it makes sense, when you think about it. It's the outcome of:

> if ain't broke don't fix it

Companies invest considerable time and money to get things off the
ground and make them work. I say to barely make them work.

Because most projects are completed beyond schedule and over budget.

As soon as that minimum acceptance is achieved there's less than zero
incentives to improve it. To polish it. Refactor it. But also to
revisit the tech debt left behind. After the struggles to make it
airborne, developers are keen to move to shinnier things. Managers
to end the apologising and proclaim "Mission Accomplished"
(_cue George W. Bush_).

Touching code that barely works becomes a risky adventure, that only
the approved go, and only when there’s a clear case for it. Fresh meat
assigned to add or fix stuff are only allowed to touch the minimal
amount of code, in the smallest amount of time. So, every 10 years,
"say hello to my little friend" (_cue Tony Montana_), aka that big-bang
rewrite.

And that’s why, everywhere you go, every company is "operating on a
knife’s edge".
