# The middle aged CTO

I'm a middle aged man. I'm 44 but not a CTO.


## The problem

It seems to be a statistical fact. Most middle aged CTO that spent years
climbing the corporate ladder find themselves in a critical role that
is right into the middle of strategic thinking and planning meetings
with no end in sight.

And every second in meetings, is a second away from the keyboard. The
keyboard that made them what they are today. The keyboard that will
intuitely tell them if this tech feels right or not.


### Decisions, decisions, decisions

But somebody needs to do it, right?

When you have competing and compelling tech options, someone needs to
have that last word. And that can last for years to come.

Is this spanking new tech a convinient way to simplify things or, in
the opposite direction, a very flexible approach that's "future-proof"?
Or just a fad and we should stick to boring tech that already works
and is battle tested?

Should we use Kubernetes for this new platform or ECS? Or containers on
Lambdas or something like CloudRun? Rust or Java?

There are very valid arguments for and against each direction. But that
decision will stick for years.
